<ul>
<li>Analyse on fly: if it is on, the engine will continue computing and you are freely to visit any move (go first, prev, next, last move) or make new moves. Whenever the current displaying position changed, the engine will be updated immediately and starts computing with new positions. You can see it's computing info via analysis displaying, analysis arrows. When the function is on, all items in right below section will be disabled (can't select)</li>
<li>Human white, computer black: you play white, chess engine plays black side</li>
<li>Human black, computer white: you play black, chess engine plays white side</li>
<li>Human both: you play both sides</li>

<li>Timer: you can choose one from different timers: </li>
<li>Standard: time-move-increment. If move number is zero, it becomes Fischer timer</li>
<li>Depth: set maximum depth for engine. </li>
<li>Move time: set max time for one side to make move</li>
<li>Nodes: set limits nodes for engines</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For depth and node modes: Human (you) won't have any limits.</p>

<p>Strength</p>
<li>Threads: set maximum number of threads the engine can use for computing. Typically it should be set below the number of total physical cores</li>
<li>Skill levels (for Stockfish only): select from 20 (max, strongest) to 0</li>
<li>NNUE mode (for Stockfish only): select between modes of using NNUE</li>

<li>Use opening book: if it is on, the app will use moves from a small book as many as possible. If it's out of the book it will let the engine starts computing</li>
